                <p>
                    Cox's Bazar is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in southeastern Bangladesh. It is famous mostly for its long natural sandy beach. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was "Palongkee".

                <p>  
                    It has the longest sea beach in the world.The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him The city covers an area of 23.4 km2 (9.0 sq mi) with 27 mahallas and 9 wards and as of 2011 had a population of 265,500.[1] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.

                    From the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under    the rule of Arakan kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666 AD.[4] When the Mughal  Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on    his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded     his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some     time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists in the  area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the  Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.

                <p>
                    The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer,  Captain Hiram Cox, who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's     Bazar) outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of Bengal following   the British East India Company Act in 1773. Cox embarked upon the task of rehabilitation  and settlement of the Arakanese refugees in the area.[5] He rehabilitated many refugees  in the area, but died in 1799 before finishing his work. To commemorate him, a market was    established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first established in  1854 and became a municipality in 1869.

                    After the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British East India Company was highly criticised on     humanitarian grounds, specially for its opium trade monopoly over the Indian    Sub-Continent. However, after its dissolution on 1 January 1874, the company's assets,     including its armed forces, were acquired by the British Crown. After this takeover,    Cox's Bazar was declared a district of the Bengal Province under the British Crown.

                <p>
                    Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2021, the  city had a population of 799,033 (638,117 in Copenhagen Municipality, 103,677 in     Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,670 in Tårnby Municipality, and 14,569 in Dragør     Municipality). It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,336,   982) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated   on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another portion of the city is located on  Amager, and it is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund    Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of  what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th    century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre  of power with its institutions, defences, and armed forces. During the Renaissance the   city served as the de facto capital being of the Kalmar Union, being the seat of  monarchy, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden     and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union  for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th     century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion.     After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of    redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden   and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of  Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked    the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age   brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second     World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the     five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural   development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city   is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major  financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's    economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives  in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of     the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish  province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised   by parks, promenades, and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The     Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle,    Frederik's Church, Børsen and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant     tourist attractions.

                <h3 className="text-danger text-center my-3">Mount Everest</h3>       
                <p>
                   Mount Everest  is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[5] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[6
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There  are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal     (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing     substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers   such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards from     avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest,[7]     many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers.     As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made    several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first   reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North     Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking    the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day:   George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never  returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top.     Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest in 1953,    using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year  as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou,    Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on    25 May 1960.

                <p>
                    The Amazon rainforest, alternatively, the Amazon jungle[a] or Amazonia, is a moist  broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of    South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000  km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory  belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest,  followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador,    French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name   of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana  Amazonian Park" for its rainforest protected area. The Amazon represents over half of the    planet's remaining rainforests,[2] and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of  tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided     into 16,000 species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are    subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged     indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of    the groups remaining largely isolated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name Amazon is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas   and other tribes. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom.   [5] Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by   Herodotus and Diodorus.[
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Amazonas, there has been fighting and wars between the neighboring tribes of the     Jivaro. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar, practised headhunting    for trophies and headshrinking.[6] The accounts of missionaries to the area in the     borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the  Yanomami tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare.

                <h3 className="text-primary text-center my-3">Sundarbans</h3>       
                <p>
                    Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges,  Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers in the Bay of Bengal. It spans from the Hooghly River in   India's state of West Bengal to the Baleswar River in Bangladesh's division of Khulna. It     comprises closed and open mangrove forests, land used for agricultural purpose, mudflats    and barren land, and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels. Four   protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz.   Sundarbans National Park, Sundarbans West, Sundarbans South and Sundarbans East Wildlife  Sanctuaries.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    Despite these protections, the Indian Sundarbans were considered endangered in a 2020   assessment under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework.[4] The Sundarbans mangrove    forest covers an area of about 10,000 km2 (3,900 sq mi), of which forests in Bangladesh's  Khulna Division extend over 6,017 km2 (2,323 sq mi) and in West Bengal, they extend over     4,260 km2 (1,640 sq mi) across the South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most abundant tree species are sundri (Heritiera fomes) and gewa (Excoecaria    agallocha). The forests provide habitat to 453 fauna wildlife, including 290 bird, 120     fish, 42 mammal, 35 reptile and eight amphibian species.[6] Despite a total ban on all  killing or capture of wildlife other than fish and some invertebrates, it appears that   there is a consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species in the 20th     century, and that the ecological quality of the forest is declining. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite preservation commitments from both governments, the Sundarbans are under threat     from both natural and human-made causes. In 2007, the landfall of Cyclone Sidr damaged  around 40% of the Sundarbans. The forest is also suffering from increased salinity due to    rising sea levels due to climate change and reduced freshwater supply. In May 2009     Cyclone Aila devastated the Sundarbans with massive casualties. At least 100,000 people     were affected by this cyclone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proposed coal-fired Rampal power station situated 14 km (8.7 mi) north of the   Sundarbans at Rampal Upazila of Bagerhat District in Khulna, Bangladesh, is anticipated   to further damage this unique mangrove forest according to a 2016 report by UNESCO.[10]   Climate change is expected to both continue to negatively effect both natural systems and     human populations in the region, resulting in further ecosystem degradation and climate     migration. Experts examining the region recommend further focus on mangrove restoration     and management and advocating for adaptation of human populations, through processes like   managed retreat and investments in resilient infrastructure.

                    The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna     in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan    (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it  also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare  (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal   gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on  other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to   have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around  32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $1     billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a    board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel   of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's     heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol   of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007,  it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                <p>
                    The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across the     historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection     against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as     early as the 7th century BC,[2] with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi     Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[3] Later     on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.     The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls,     allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or   encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.[4] Furthermore, the     defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of    watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means   of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a   transportation corridor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they   stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day   Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that     roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning over 20,000 km (12,000 mi)    in total.[5] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one  of the most impressive architectural feats in history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.
                    The Chinese character 城, meaning city or fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the "earth" radical 土 and phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *deŋ.[8] It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese word for "city".
